## 2026-05-18 — Visual polish: ContactTable initials + WeekHintBar (PR #33)

**What.** Two small visual upgrades cherry-picked from the PR #26 audit (which itself was closed as superseded — see audit comments on that PR for the full triage).

1. **ContactTable mobile cards: initials avatar** instead of the generic `<User />` icon. New `getInitials(first, last)` helper at the top of `src/components/database/ContactTable.tsx`. The avatar is a 36px teal-soft circle with bold uppercase initials — same visual language as the Avatar pattern used in `PrioritiesTab` and `ContactQuickSheet`. Mobile cards now feel like individual people rather than identical "User icon + name" rows.
2. **`WeekHintBar` shared component** at `src/components/spheresync/WeekHintBar.tsx`. Renders the "Week N rotates letters A, B, C (calls); texts go to D" banner with letter chips. Accepts an optional `weekNumber` prop (defaults to the current ISO week) so the same component can serve other rotation views in the future. **Not wired in this PR** — `PrioritiesTab` is touched by the in-flight Phase 2 PR (#32) and I didn't want to create a merge conflict for a single-import line. Wiring is a 2-line follow-up.

**Why.** Audit of the older PR #26 ("Agent Ops HQ redesign") flagged these as the durable visual ideas worth keeping; the rest of #26 was superseded by the May 2026 dashboard/sidebar work or broke against Pam's 7 flat stages.

**Skipped from the original audit list.** The cadence stat-tile redesign — the existing `GoalBar` in `CadenceTab.tsx` is already clean, so the redesign was lower value-vs-scope than the other two.

**Source.** PR #26 audit report (recorded in the prior session); user direction to ship the surviving visual ideas as a small focused PR.

## 2026-05-14 — System architecture doc + working-notes foundation (PR #29)

**What.** Added three foundational docs so future sessions don't start cold:
- `docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` — ~7,000-word partner-readable architecture write-up. Cadence, temperature scoring, pipeline, AI Coach (with honest "wired vs parked" notes), Scoreboard, Newsletter/Delight/Events, scheduled jobs, security.
- `docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.pdf` — 22-page PDF rendered via `markdown` + `reportlab`. For sharing with partners outside GitHub.
- `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root — dense working notes auto-loaded into every Claude Code chat. Conventions, file map by feature, brand tokens, gotchas, current state.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — this file.

**Why.** Knowledge was scattered across user-level memory entries (some stale by months), git commit messages, and Slack/email threads. New chats started cold on project conventions, leading to repeated mistakes ("which CRM column is the source of truth for brand colors?", "why is 'deal' replaced everywhere?"). The three-layer foundation (repo CLAUDE.md → docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE → docs/DECISIONS) is loaded automatically and stays current per the update rule above.

**Method.** Five parallel research agents mapped: cadence + priority + AI Coach + cron jobs + page inventory against the live codebase. Every claim grounded in file:line refs or live DB queries.

## 2026-05-14 — Pam's 7 pipeline stages (PR #28)

**What.** Replaced the buyer/seller/referral 3-set stage model with a single universal flat list of 7 stages per Pam's April 10 technical brief.

**New stage keys (in order):**
1. `conversation_active`
2. `opportunity_identified`
3. `consultation_completed`
4. `client_secured`
5. `active_opportunity`
6. `under_contract`
7. `closed`
8. `lost` *(8th, terminal, off-board by default)*

Plus `NULL` = sphere-only opportunity (in `opportunities` table but off the kanban).

**Key migrations / files:**
- Migration `supabase/migrations/20260514000001_pam_pipeline_stages.sql` — applied to live DB May 14
- `src/config/pipelineStages.ts` — rewritten flat. Dropped: `META_STAGES`, `STAGE_TO_META`, `getStagesForType`, `defaultSubStage`, `getMetaStageForKey`, `subStageLabel`, `BUYER_STAGES`/`SELLER_STAGES`/`REFERRAL_STAGES`. Added: `PIPELINE_STAGES`, `StageKey`, `getAllStages()`, `getBoardStages()`, `getStageShortLabel()`.
- Updated consumers: `PipelineBoard`, `PipelineColumn`, `PipelineCanvas`, `StageLabel`, `StagePicker`, `OpportunityCard`, `AddOpportunityDialog`, `EditOpportunityDialog`, `OpportunityDetailV2`, `TodayOpportunityCard`, `usePipeline`, `usePipelineFilters`, `components/dashboard/Modules.tsx`.

**Decisions baked in (from approval round):**
| # | Question | Picked |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Lost stage | (a) Keep as 8th terminal, off-board |
| 2 | Nurturing | (c) Sphere-only via NULL stage — drops NOT NULL on `opportunities.stage` |
| 3 | `active_deal` → `active_opportunity` | Yes (consistent with deals→opportunities rename) |
| 4 | Buyer/seller stage granularity | OK to lose column-level distinction (still tracked via `opportunity_type` badge) |
| 5 | Board layout | 7 fixed-width 200px columns + horizontal scroll fallback below ~1100px |
| 6 | Stage history | (a) Rewrite in place, no timestamp churn — used `DISABLE TRIGGER USER` to suppress side-effects |
| 7 | Detail card | Keep as-is — no UI redesign |

**Trigger fix.** `log_opportunity_stage_change()` updated to skip the history INSERT when `NEW.stage IS NULL` (the column became nullable; without this, "move card back to sphere-only" would crash on the NOT NULL `to_stage` constraint).

**Migration verification.** Against live DB: 6 opportunities remapped (2 conversation_active, 2 active_opportunity, 1 sphere-only, 1 closed); 21 history rows rewritten in place; 0 unmapped values.

**Source.** Pam's April 10 email "the whole chat with Claude.ai" — SphereSync Pipeline Technical Build Brief, Step 1 stage list. UI column labels (ALL-CAPS short) and badge labels (sentence case) taken from her April 9 screenshots in "Pipeline (conversion engine!)" email.

## 2026-05-13 — Dashboard rebuild, Settings overhaul, opportunities terminology (PR #27)

**What.** Multi-week sweep across the Hub. One commit, three major surfaces:

### Dashboard rebuilt as Commander Home

- Matches `design/dashboard-v2.html` reference.
- New components: `CommanderHero` (dark-blue band, 4 KPI cells, agent-only greeting), `StreakCard` (call-streak with 7-week grid), `Modules` (Sphere touches / Pipeline value / Delight sent), `RecentActivityFeed` (no `outcome IS NOT NULL` filter, honest verbs like "Dialed X" vs "Talked with X"), `UpcomingEvents`, `JumpBackIn` (role-aware via `useFeatureAccess`).
- Removed: `CoachAlertsStrip`, `PriorityQueueCard`, `StuckDealsRow`, `WeekStatusCard`, `SphereHealthRow`, `DelightRow`, `UpcomingAndCadence` (over-built); plus orphaned `DashboardCards`, `DashboardCharts`, `PipelineLiveWidget`.
- KPIs from real queries — no fake sparklines, no fabricated trends. Conversations YTD replaced GCI YTD on the hero (GCI was unreliable: `transaction_coordination` only has data for 5/19 agents, `opportunities.gci_actual` is universally empty).
- Sphere touches KPI = calls + texts (not just calls).
- Coach `next_hour.first_sentence` is rendered as a "Suggested opener" chip, NOT as the page headline (it caused the "Hi Brian" bug where a contact's name appeared as the greeting).

### Settings rewritten — 7 sections

- Profile / Brand / Goals / Notifications / Billing / Security / Data & export.
- New: `AssetUploader` (headshot + logos to `agent-assets` bucket), `useNotificationPrefs` hook, `useUserProfile.save()` method.
- New columns on `agent_marketing_settings`: `signature_block`, `sender_name`.
- New columns on `profiles`: `timezone`, `reminder_day`, `quiet_hours_start`/`_end`, `notify_email`, `notify_in_app`.

### Phase 0 dedup migration

`supabase/migrations/20260504000001_dedupe_profiles_brand_columns.sql` dropped 13 duplicate brand columns from `profiles` (primary_color, secondary_color, headshot_url, logo_colored_url, logo_white_url, gpt_prompt, brand_guidelines, example_copy, metricool_creds, clickup_editing_task_list_id, clickup_video_deliverables_list_id, shade_folder_id, editors) + 5 legacy capitalized columns + the empty `license_states` dupe.

**Critical: `agent_marketing_settings` is now the single source of truth for brand.** Don't read brand fields from `profiles` anywhere — they no longer exist.

Verified zero data loss: every profiles row whose brand column was non-NULL had an equal-or-fresher value in `agent_marketing_settings`.

### Deals → Opportunities terminology

Replaced ~50 user-facing "deal/deals" strings across 18 files with "opportunity/opportunities" / "closing" / "sale" / "transaction" as context dictated:

- "Active deal" → "Active opportunity"
- "X closed deals" → "X closings"
- "Deal Value" → "Estimated Value" (or "Sale Price" depending on context)
- "Avg Deal Velocity" → "Avg Time to Close"
- "Pipeline & deal tracking" → "Pipeline & opportunity tracking"

**Preserved as-is:**
- Internal TypeScript types: `interface Deal`, `DealStage`, `dealsByStage`
- DB column names: `deal_value`, `buyer_deal_breakers`
- Variable names: `setDealField`, `dealVelocity`, `const dealResults`
- The industry term **"Deal-breakers"** ("things a buyer won't accept") — different word usage
- Code comments

### Coaching cron timezone-aware

`coaching-weekly-nudge` now respects each agent's `notify_in_app` opt-out + `quiet_hours_*` window in their local `timezone` before inserting an action item. Uses `Intl.DateTimeFormat` per-agent. Handles wrap-around midnight windows correctly.

### Token cleanup

New tokens: `reop-green-soft`, `reop-hero-stat-bg/border/eyebrow/sub/trend`, `reop-warm-soft/fg`, `reop-surface-subtle/muted`. Removed all raw `hsl(...)` literals from the dashboard surface. Remaining `hsl(var(--reop-*) / X)` patterns are token-with-opacity (valid).

**Source.** Multiple user iterations: dashboard rebuild against `design/dashboard-v2.html`, settings overhaul as configuration center, opportunities rename per user request "Real Estate Agents don't like that term", coaching nudge timezone fix as part of Notifications wiring.
